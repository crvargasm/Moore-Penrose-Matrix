# Moore-Penrose-Matrix
A small implementation of an algorithm that is capable of computing the Moore-Penrose inverse of any matrix. 

Although these matrices are not well known throughout the world, their application can be useful when it comes to finding the inverse of a property 
matrix and not performing an easy calculation; They are also useful in finding and calculating an "optimal" solution to systems of linear equations. 
Answers cannot be easily calculated.

Therefore, the correct coding of a program that helps us calculate the pseudo-inverse of a matrix is important, in order to optimize mathematical 
processes when solving problems abstracted from the real world.
